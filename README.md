# go-forward-proxy
GoForwardProxu is a Go project combining a custom HTTP server and a forward proxy built from scratch using standard libraries. The proxy receives client requests, forwards them to the internal server, and returns responses, demonstrating lightweight end-to-end request handling and proxying.
